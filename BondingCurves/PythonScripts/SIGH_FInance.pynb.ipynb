    " - The things that are indexed on the Graph are called sub-Graphs (accessibe via GRAPHQL)\n",
    "\n",
    "Consumers send indexers queries, along with micropayments, which are settled in Graph Tokens (GRT)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When consumers come to the Graph, they use the on-chain service discovery layer to find indexers that can serve their queries.\n",
    "Indexers compete to provide the best service, speed and security to the consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "GRT, The Graph's native token, is used for the following functions :\n",
    "1. Settling Query Fees\n",
    "2. Curator Signaling\n",
    "3. Indexer Staking\n",
    "4. Delegator Staking\n",
    "5. Indexer Rewards (New Token Issuance)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Query Cost Model\n",
    "Agora (a tool used by Indexers), allows Indexers and Consumers to extract featrues of the GraphQL query and assign price to that Query.\n",
    " - A query does not have a fixed price at the network level. The pricing model resumbles more of a negotiation that takes place between Consumers and Indexers.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Curation Market\n",
    "Curators signal on subgraphs, locking up GRT in exchange for a Curation Reward, which is paid as a share of future query fees.\n",
    "![image-2.png](attachment:image-2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem ? : For bootstrapping these markets (each sub-graph is a market)\n",
    "Why will an Indexer dedicate his time and resources to index a sub-graph (indexing is a compute intensive operation, it may takes days to index a large sub-graph) ? This is where curation markets come-in --> \n",
    "Their role is to provide signal to the indexers in the network , i.e helping identifying which sub-graphs are needed to be indexed (kind of a prediction market for valuable sub-graphs)\n",
    "\n",
    "CURATORS : They signal GRT tokens into a bonding curve, which entitles them to the shares that are minted by the bonding curve, i.e curation rewards that are received by that curators.\n",
    "Curation rewards are a portion of a future query fees that are collected on that sub-graph.\n",
    "So, the more effective you are in choosing sub-graphs to curate on that produces more query fees in the future, the more you will be able to earn as curators.\n",
    "BANCOR BONDING CURVE FORMULA used for this bonding curve.\n",
    "Curators can withdraw their shares once the bonding curve reaches a new state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Curation Markets are expected to attract indexers to allocate stake to specific sub-graph. \n",
    " - Indexers stake into the protocol as a whole, and then allocate that between sub-graphs.\n",
    "     - Indexers receive indexer rewards (paid for new token issuance) and query fees (micro-payments)\n",
    "     \n",
    "#### INDEXER REWARDS\n",
    "- The more curator signal that is on a sub-graph, the more indexer rewards, proportionally, than sub-graph will get in the network. \n",
    "- Then, that sub-graph's indexer rewards are distributed evenly between the indexers, proportional to the amount of allocated stake on that sub-graph.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     $$R_i = \\sum_{} \\frac{W_{ij}}{TW_j} * \\frac{S_j}{TS} * N$$\n",

    "     __N__ - Total Network indexing reward denominated in GRT  <br>\n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "#### QUERY FEES\n",
    " - Query Fees are not directly paid to the indexers. Rather, they are collected in a rebate pool, where they can later be claimed according to a __*rebate reward function*__.\n",
    "\n",
    "     $$Y_i = \\sum_{} ({ \\frac{W_{ij}}{TW} })^{1-\\alpha} * (\\frac{P_{ij}}{TP})^\\alpha $$\n",

    "     __N__ - Total Protocol Fee collected by the Protocol <br>\n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "### PROTOCOL FEE\n",
    " - Protocol Fees provide a dis-incentive for spoofing query volume, making query fees a useful indicator of activity protocol. \n",
    " - It ensures that the market signals being provided are the ones that can be trusted.  \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## DELEGATION\n",
    " - Delegated Stake is not slashed.\n",
    " - Indexers have a delegation capacity.\n",
    " - Delegation capacity is a ratio of Indexers owned stake.\n",
    " \n",
    " What it means is that for every unit of slashable stake, an indexer is allowed some amount of delegated stake which is not slashable.\n",
    " 1. It allows passive token holders to still want to participate in the protocol\n",
    " 2. It helps secure and adds resistance to the protocol\n",
    " 3. It also ensures that the delegators do not need to have too much of a trust relationsip with the Indexers\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " ### Indexer Parameters \n",
    "  - Indexer Rewards Cut : Ratio of the rewards that the Indexers keep with themselves\n",
    "  - Query Fee Cut : Ratio of the rewards that the Indexers keep with themselves\n",
    "  \n",
    "      __*delegation rewards = indexer_rewards * (i - reward_cut) + query_fees * (1 - fee_Cut)*__\n",
    "\n",
    " Delegation rewards are distributed among the delegators on the sub-graph.\n",

    "## QUERY VALIDATION AND SLASHING\n",
    "Query Validation and Slashing is done by an Arbitrator (set via Decentralized Governance). Slashable Offenses are :\n",
    " - Invalid Attestations : In order to unlock a micro-payment, an indexer has to to provide an Attestation. Implying, here what the indexer actually providing are the means to slash them, if the response is in-correct!\n",
    " - Invalid Proofs of Indexing : Indexers claim their indxing rewards by providing their proofs of Indexing. So, anytime an Indexer closes an allocation and claims the indexing rewards on that allocation, they supply a signed digest of messages produced during indexing. These help verify that the indexer actually indexed the data for which he is trying to claim the rewards.  \n",
